**TTTGame**

The project is based on the game of Tic Tac Toe, contains 2 game options - the classic one and 9 in 1 variation:
- user-friendly interface built with Java Swing
- HashMap to store players' nicknames and scores
- single and two-player modes with 3 difficulty levels.

It is my first java project, fully written by me. I'm pretty proud (doesn't matter it's not perfect ;))

### Main objectives:
- create a game using Java Swing
- file handling - all scores are saved in a .txt file and being updated everytime the user plays
- broad my Java knowledge but don't start from basics.

### Functionality:
